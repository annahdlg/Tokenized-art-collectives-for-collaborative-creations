# 🌍 Decentralized Supply Chain Transparency

Welcome to a revolutionary platform for transparent, blockchain-based supply chain management! Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity, this project empowers producers, distributors, certifiers, and consumers to track goods from origin to end-user, ensuring authenticity, ethical sourcing, and transparency.

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 **Track Provenance**: Trace the full journey of a product, from raw materials to final sale.
- 📜 **Immutable Records**: Store tamper-proof data for products, certifications, and transactions.
- 🏅 **Tokenized Incentives**: Reward verified participants (e.g., ethical producers) with native tokens.
- ✅ **Authenticity Verification**: Verify product details and certifications instantly.
- 🚚 **Supply Chain Updates**: Allow authorized stakeholders to update product journey milestones.
- 🔐 **Permissioned Access**: Restrict sensitive data access to authorized parties.
- 🤝 **Collaborative Trust**: Enable certifiers to validate ethical or quality standards.

## 🛠 How It Works

### For Producers
1. Register a product with a unique ID and metadata (e.g., origin, batch details).
2. Generate a hash of the product’s documentation (e.g., using SHA-256).
3. Call the `register-product` function to record the product on the blockchain.
4. Update product journey (e.g., manufacturing, packaging) via `update-journey`.

### For Distributors
1. Use `update-journey` to log transport or storage details (e.g., shipment dates, warehouse conditions).
2. Verify product authenticity before accepting goods using `verify-product`.

### For Certifiers
1. Validate product claims (e.g., organic, fair trade) by registering certifications via `add-certification`.
2. Earn tokens for providing trusted certifications.

### For Consumers
1. Scan a product’s QR code to retrieve its unique ID.
2. Use `get-product-details` to view the product’s origin, journey, and certifications.
3. Verify authenticity and ethical claims with `verify-product` and `check-certification`.

### For Token Holders
1. Stake tokens to participate in governance (e.g., approving new certifiers).
2. Earn rewards for verifying or auditing supply chain data.
